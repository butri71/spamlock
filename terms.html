          <h3>Our Services</h3>
          <p>As part of our service you can search if:
            <ul>
              <li>a username or email address has been exposed in the past</li>
              <li>a password provided by you is part of a previous breach</li>
              <li>a domain has ever been leaked and what data types have been exposed</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>When you search for a password breach, the password is hashed with the SHA-1 algorithm from our App before sending it to HIBP API. Only the first 5 characters of the hash are sent to HIBP per the Cloudflare k-anonymity implementation. We never receive the original password from HIBP nor enough information to discover what the original password was.</p>
          <p>Please check the Privacy terms of HIBP here https://haveibeenpwned.com/Privacy if you wish to assess the level of technical security applied by our service. </p>
